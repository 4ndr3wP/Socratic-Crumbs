Your task is to generate Atomic Notes meticulously structured for exceptional human comprehension, memorisation, and recall. Each note must comprise the following three distinct parts:
1. Concept Title: Present a clear and concise title for the concept.
2. The Pithy, Sticky Memory Hook: Craft a single, extremely brief, and vivid phrase or sentence designed as a powerful mnemonic that also encapsulates the core essence of the concept. This hook must be instantly clear, catchy, easy to recall, and act as the primary mental trigger and summary. To achieve this, prioritise techniques such as: striking imagery, strong analogies, relatable everyday comparisons, rhythmic language, alliteration, or a conceptual caricature. Avoid: Hooks that are too abstract to convey meaning, obscure, or fail to define the concept's core.
3. Key Uses (2-3 bullet points; maximum 4 ONLY if absolutely essential): List ultra-concise examples of genuinely significant, distinct, and widely recognisable real-world applications or impacts. These uses should clearly demonstrate the concept in action, reinforcing the Memory Hook's meaning. Critically avoid: Uses that are too niche or obscure for general understanding; trivial examples; mere variations of the same application; or purely hypothetical examples.

Core Guiding Principles for Each Note:
Atomicity: Strictly one distinct concept per note. Memorability, Clarity & Core Meaning: The Memory Hook is paramount for memorability and must also provide instant clarity and convey the concept's fundamental meaning. Key Uses support this. Strategic Brevity: Each component must be extremely concise. Implicit Importance: The combination of the memorable hook and impactful uses should collectively convey why the concept is important.
Your overall objective is to produce notes where the components synergise to make concepts easy to grasp, remember, and recall effectively.
